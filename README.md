## Note on Login Functionality

For the login functionality to work, make sure you are running a server for both
the frontend and backend on `http://localhost:8887` and `http://localhost:5000`
respectively.


You'll also need to have created the database beforehand - go to
`http://localhost:5000/create_db` to do this. This should only need to be run
once.
